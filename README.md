How to run our program?
Type the java DNAList (arraysize) (file address), for example "java DNAList 20 in.txt". You can also directly enter the method into scanner.
You can use every method directly, as long as it follow the method rule on Lab3_dna.doc
The Enum DNA and Enum RNA is for defining the type, the DNAList project is construct by a outer LinkedList which contains inner DNAList<DNA/RNA>
ps: Why so hard???
ps2: Where is the singly linkedlist/double linked list on the course mentioned in the doc???
